# traincore_dl

**traincore_dl** is a lightweight modular deep learning training core,
designed to unify and streamline model training workflows for different architectures
such as CNNs, GNNs, and hybrid models.  
It provides a clean and extensible structure for research and engineering projects.

> 一個輕量化、模組化的深度學習訓練核心，  
> 專為研究與工程開發設計，可在不同架構（CNN、GNN、Hybrid）之間共用統一訓練邏輯。
